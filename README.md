# Neovim Config

LazyVim-based setup tuned for R and Quarto work, run inside Kitty. This repo owns the Neovim bits; broader dotfiles live in the separate `yadm` repo.

## Install

Clone into `~/.config/nvim`, start Neovim, and run `:Lazy sync` once to fetch the pinned plugins.

## Themes

- Catppuccin (mocha) loads on startup. Reapply it any time with `<leader>uc` or `:CatppuccinTheme [flavour]`.
- Nord stays available on `<leader>un` / `:NordTheme`.
- TokyoNight cycles with `<leader>ut`; toggle transparency with `<leader>uT`.

All theme tooling belongs to this Neovim repoâ€”manage it with `git` inside `~/.config/nvim` rather than `yadm`.

## Dotfiles backup

The repo also tracks non-Neovim config that pairs with this setup. To install the AeroSpace keybinding config on a new machine, run:

```bash
./scripts/link-dotfiles.sh
```

That will symlink `dotfiles/aerospace/.aerospace.toml` into `~/.aerospace.toml`. Reload AeroSpace (`aerospace reload-config`) to apply the shortcuts.
